# Task List

You may do these tasks in any order, but take note that they are listed in the order your team has prioritized completing them.

Reminder that you are NOT expected to complete all tasks. You are expected to write clean, readable code. Remember to add comments explaining what you were working on if you run out of time in the middle of a task.

## Task 1

Your team needs to query some JSON API endpoints to pull in place and image data to display on the app. In `Place.swift`, implement:

```swift
static func loadPlacesWithImages(queue: DispatchQueue = .main, callback: @escaping ([Place]) -> Void)
```

This method should load the place list data from https://byteboard.dev/api/data/places and combine with images from https://byteboard.dev/api/data/img/{placeId}, returning an array of `Place` structs containing all essential place data.

## Task 2

Users should be able to filter which places they see using the search bar. In `ListViewController.swift`, implement:

```swift
static func filterPlaces(places: [Place], filter: String?) -> [Place]
```

to return an array of places that match the filter string.

### Task 3

When a user selects a place on the list of places, they should be able to then view all the details associated with that place. If you tap on a place now, you'll see this `PlaceViewController`, which is in need of better styling.

Implement the rest of the view controller in `PlaceViewController.swift` to match the wireframe in the Part 1 document.
